 ### Hi there, I'm Lucy Zhu ðŸ‘‹

I have been worked as a web frontend engineer for almost 13 years.

Love to explore the underlying principles of frameworks, I have once developed tool kits similar to Webpack and Vue.

Mastering technologies as listed below:
- Vue2 & Vue3
- React
- Svelte
- Nodejs
- Webpack & Vite & Esbuild
- Web component
- Web Assembly

I also know how to write the backend languages like Go, Python and etc. I once used Python for crawling website data to generate statistical diagram.


### Working Experience

***Fengtu Technology Co., LTD***  2020.12-2023.12

#### Job Content
1. In charge of collecting demands and managing process about projects;

2. Mainly in responsible for choosing the appropriate framework for projects;

3. Leading the development of common component library based on Vue2, Vue3, focusing on the Map and Low-code projects.

#### Accomplishments
1. I have once leaded a small group of 6 people to accomplish the project estimated over 90 million RMB. The project adopted a totally new technology named Shu-Sheng, which aims at 3D highly rendering maps. Taking various factors into account, my leader decided to appoint me to be the Project Manager. After hard working of over 6 months, the project had been finished ahead of deadline for over half a month, which had been highly praised by my highest leader. Thus, the project was awarded the best project prize.
2. I have accomplished common components libraries and then released them as npm packages, which were based on Vue2, Vue3 and web components.
3. I have also developed low-code framework from 0 to 1, which greatly facilitates coworkers to generate project pages in a quite short time.
4. I have produced CLI tools based on Nodejs to allow front-end engineers to choose the appropriate modules for different projects, thus generating the project codes automatically just like Vue CLI.



### Status

Now, I live in Wuhan, China. I never stop learning, as an old saying goes:"Life is limited, but learning is not." I have been enrolled by Huazhong University of Science and Technology for MBA major. My expectation is to become a technical manager in the future.
